Coroutines
**********

   The `coroutine' class defines a block of code which can be suspended
at any point and later resumed.


class coroutine
{
    friend void dispatch_c( coroutine * c );
public:
    virtual ~coroutine ();
    
    // Accessors
    inline bool terminated( void ) const;
    
    // Modifiers
    void resume( void );
    void call( void );
    
    static size_t cStackSize;
protected:
    coroutine( );
    
    void detach( void );
        virtual void main( void ) = 0;	// Coroutine body
    
    static unsigned long _num_ctx_switch;	// Number of context switches
private:
    inline void swapContext( ucontext_t * old_context );
    
    ucontext_t  *_context;
    bool        _cor_terminated;
    coroutine   *_caller;
    coroutine   *_callee;
    static coroutine *_current_coroutine;
